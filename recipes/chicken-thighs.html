            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>2 lb chicken thighs</li>
                    <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
                    <li>1 cup bbq sauce, divided</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Step 1: Turn on your Instant Pot, select saute function. Heat oil until 
                        hot. Add chicken thighs and cook until browned, about 3 minutes on each
                         side. Transfer chicken to a plate.</li>

                    <li>Step 2: Pour chicken broth into the pot. Cook and scrape up brown bits 
                        with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pot, about 1 minute. Turn off the 
                        Instant Pot. Add celery, 1/2 cup bbq sauce, and browned chicken thighs 
                        to the pot. Stir to combine</li>

                    <li>Step 3: Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to 
                        manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 8 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 
                        minutes for pressure to build.</li>

                    <li>Step 4: Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat 
                        the oven's broiler to low.</li>

                    <li>Step 5: Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according
                         to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
                          Transfer chicken to a baking sheet and baste with remaining 1/2 cup bbq 
                          sauce.</li>

                    <li>Step 6: Broil for 5 minutes or until crisp.</li>
